### Monorepo Structure

```
apps/
  frontend/    → Astro 6 + React + shadcn/ui (player-facing web app)
  backend/     → Express + Apollo Server + Supabase (API)
  manager/     → React + Vite + Apollo + Radix (organizer/admin dashboard)
packages/      → Shared code (types, utils, GraphQL fragments)
```

## Hard Rule: No Emojis in UI (Mandatory)

**Never use emoji characters in any user-facing UI** (`.tsx`, `.astro`, JSX templates, button labels, banner text, status indicators, page content, etc.). Emojis render inconsistently across OSes/fonts and break the FIFA stadium aesthetic.

### Required behavior

1. ALWAYS use icons from **`lucide-react`** for every icon, glyph, or pictogram. The library is already installed in `apps/frontend`.
2. In `.astro` files, import lucide icons and use them like Astro components — Astro renders React components statically (no `client:*` directive needed) so they ship as inline SVG with zero JS cost.
3. NEVER install a second icon library (Heroicons, Material Icons, FontAwesome, react-icons, etc.) — one library, one visual language.
4. NEVER inline raw `<svg>` markup for icons that exist in lucide-react.
5. The full guidance (sizing, color tokens, accessibility, common name mappings) lives in `.claude/rules/design-system.md` under the **Iconography** section. Read that section before adding any icon.
6. Comments documenting _replacements_ of legacy emoji code (e.g. "replaced 🧤 with `Hand`") are allowed — the prohibition applies to UI-rendered text only.

## Hard Rule: Frontend Rules First (Mandatory)

Before working on any file under `apps/frontend/**`, always read `.claude/rules/frontend.md` first.

## Hard Rule: Backend Rules First (Mandatory)

Before working on any file under `apps/backend/**`, always read `.claude/rules/backend.md` first.
When backend work touches GraphQL schema/resolvers/contracts, also read `.claude/rules/graphql.md`.

### Required behavior

1. Treat `.claude/rules/backend.md` as the source of truth for backend architecture and coding constraints.
2. Follow its required folder structure, import rules, RLS/client patterns, and caching constraints on every backend task.
3. Apply `.claude/rules/graphql.md` for backend GraphQL work and run codegen after `.graphql` edits.
4. If a backend task needs an exception, update the rule file first (or ask for confirmation) before implementing code changes.

## Hard Rule: E2E Testing Rules First (Mandatory)

Before adding, refactoring, or debugging any file under `apps/testing/tests/**`, always read `.claude/rules/e2e-testing.md` first.

### Required behavior

1. Treat `.claude/rules/e2e-testing.md` as the source of truth for the e2e architecture (page objects, fixtures, auth storage state, GraphQL mocking, builders).
2. Specs MUST import from the `tests/support` barrel; raw selectors and per-test login flows are not allowed when an existing Page Object or fixture covers them.
3. Authenticated specs MUST consume saved storage state via `test.use({ storageState: TEST_USERS.<role>.storageStatePath })` — `tests/auth.setup.ts` produces those files once per run.
4. Add or update Decision Context blocks in specs and Page Objects whenever behaviour or mocking strategy changes.

### Astro SSR Strategy (CRITICAL)

Use **hybrid rendering** (`output: 'hybrid'` in astro.config). Pages are **static by default** and opt into SSR only when needed.

**Use static (default) for:**

- Landing page, about, legal pages
- Public match/tournament listings (hydrate filters client-side)
- Any page where content is the same for all users

**Use SSR (`export const prerender = false`) only when:**

- The page requires auth-gated data that cannot be fetched client-side
- The page needs server-side redirects based on session state
- SEO requires personalized or real-time content in the initial HTML

**Hydration rules:**

- Use `client:load` for interactive components that must work immediately (nav, auth forms)
- Use `client:visible` for components below the fold (match cards, filters, maps)
- Use `client:idle` for non-critical interactivity (notifications badge, tooltips)
- **Never** use `client:load` on heavy components that are not above the fold
- Prefer Astro islands (`.astro` files) for static content — only use React components when interactivity is needed

### shadcn/ui Convention

- Components live in `apps/frontend/src/components/ui/`
- Install components via `npx shadcn@latest add <component>` from the frontend app directory
- All shadcn components are React — wrap them in Astro islands with appropriate `client:` directive
- Use the `cn()` utility from `@/lib/utils` for conditional class merging
- Follow shadcn's composition pattern: primitives in `ui/`, feature components compose them
- Theme tokens defined in `apps/frontend/src/styles/globals.css` using CSS custom properties

### GraphQL Communication

- **Backend** defines the schema in `apps/backend/src/graphql/schema/*.graphql`
- **Frontend** defines operations (queries/mutations) in `apps/frontend/src/graphql/operations/`
- After any `.graphql` change, run `pnpm codegen` from the repo root
- **urql** is the frontend GraphQL client — configured with SSR exchange for server-rendered pages and cache exchange for client-side
- For SSR pages, execute GraphQL queries server-side in Astro's frontmatter and pass data as props to React islands
- For static pages, fetch data at build time or hydrate client-side via urql

### Supabase Integration

- **Database**: PostgreSQL with camelCase naming and quoted identifiers
- **Auth**: Supabase Auth handles registration, login, password reset — `profiles` table extends `auth.users`
- **Storage**: Use Supabase Storage for profile photos and club images — always verify bucket exists before writing URLs
- **RLS**: All tables have RLS enabled — policies scoped to `auth.uid()` ownership chain
- **Client access**: Backend uses user-scoped Supabase clients for writes (see `backend.md` RLS pattern)
- **MCP**: All schema changes and migrations go through Supabase MCP tools (see Hard Rule below)

### Scalability Decisions

- **Redis caching**: All read-heavy paths use `cacheGetOrSet()` — match listings, tournament brackets, leaderboard
- **GraphQL DataLoader**: Batch queries to prevent N+1 in resolvers
- **Supabase egress control**: Explicit column selection only, no `select('*')` — see `backend.md`
- **Static-first frontend**: Astro pre-renders what it can, reducing server load
- **Connection pooling**: Supabase handles connection pooling via PgBouncer — no direct pg pool management needed
- **Code splitting**: Astro islands architecture naturally code-splits — each React component is an independent bundle

## Hard Rule: Prompt Tracking Log (Mandatory)

After finishing EVERY user task, the agent MUST create exactly one new markdown file inside `docs/prompts/`.

### Required behavior

1. Generate a random task ID (recommended: 8+ lowercase alphanumeric characters).
2. Check `docs/prompts/` to ensure the generated ID is not already used.
3. If there is a collision, generate a new random ID and retry.
4. Filename format MUST be: `docs/prompts/<random-id>-prompt-log.md`.
   - Examples: `a7f3k9q2-prompt-log.md`, `x4m1t8vb-prompt-log.md`.
5. Do not use sequential numbering.
6. The file content MUST include:
   - The user prompt, copied explicitly, with secrets redacted.
   - Exactly 3 bullet points summarizing what the agent mainly did.
   - A timestamp.
7. This rule is mandatory and must not be skipped.
8. If the user prompt contains secrets, mask the sensitive values with `****` in the prompt log.
   - Applies to API keys, tokens, passwords, private keys, connection strings, and webhook secrets.
   - Keep useful context, but never store raw secret values in `docs/prompts/`.

### Required file template

```md
# Prompt Log

- Timestamp: YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss
- Task ID: <random-id>

## User Prompt

> [Paste the user prompt here, redacting any secrets as ****]

## Agent Main Actions

- [Main action 1]
- [Main action 2]
- [Main action 3]
```

### Enforcement

- The task is not complete until the corresponding prompt log file is created in `docs/prompts/`.

## Hard Rule: Notion Documentation Update (Mandatory)

After finishing any feature implementation or business logic change, the agent MUST update the Notion page `sumateya/docs`.

### Required behavior

1. Update `sumateya/docs` after implementation is complete and before considering the task fully done.
2. Include at minimum:
   - What changed (feature/logic summary)
   - Affected modules or areas
   - Any data/migration or operational notes
3. If Notion access is unavailable, request user authentication and continue once access is restored.

## Hard Rule: Database Operations via Supabase MCP (Mandatory)

All database operations MUST be executed through Supabase MCP tools.

### Required behavior

1. Use Supabase MCP for schema changes, migrations, SQL execution, data updates, and database diagnostics.
2. Do not perform direct DB operations through local scripts/CLI when Supabase MCP should be used.
3. If Supabase MCP access is missing or unauthenticated, stop DB-related work and ask the user to authenticate before continuing.
4. Never provide raw SQL snippets to users for manual execution in Supabase.
5. If the user requests SQL, translate the request into Supabase MCP operations instead of returning SQL text.
6. Never instruct users to run SQL directly in the Supabase dashboard SQL editor.
7. Always insist on connecting/authenticating Supabase MCP first before any DB-related operation.

## Hard Rule: Typecheck Before Completion (Mandatory)

After any task that edits files in the workspace, the agent MUST run `turbo typecheck --force` from the repository root before marking the task complete.

### Required behavior

1. Run `turbo typecheck --force` after the final edit set for the task.
2. Treat a non-zero exit code as a blocking failure.
3. Do not mark the task complete, successful, or ready for review unless the command passes.
4. If the command fails, continue fixing issues until it passes or explicitly report the blocker.

## Hard Rule: E2E Regression Check Before Completion (Mandatory)

Before finishing any functionality or behavior change, the agent MUST run the relevant e2e tests in background mode with `showreport off` to check for regressions in the touched flow.

### Required behavior

1. Start with the narrowest e2e coverage that exercises the changed path.
2. If the e2e run finds regressions, fix them in the same task before marking the work complete.
3. Do not mark the task complete, successful, or ready for review until the relevant e2e checks pass or are clearly blocked by an external dependency.

## Hard Rule: Decision Context Comment Blocks (Mandatory)

After implementing any feature or changing business logic, the agent MUST add or update a decision context comment block in the changed code.

### Required behavior

1. Add one structured comment block near the main logic change (or update the existing one if present).
2. The block MUST explain:
   - Why this implementation approach was chosen
   - Full context and constraints considered
   - Previously fixed bugs/regressions this code is protecting against
   - Key assumptions and operational caveats
3. Keep comments concrete and maintainable (specific, concise, and tied to real logic decisions).
4. If there are no relevant historical bugs, explicitly write: `Previously fixed bugs: none relevant.`
5. When future edits alter the rationale or constraints, update the same block instead of duplicating comments.

### Why this helps the agent

- Preserves decision history directly in the code to reduce context loss between tasks.
- Prevents regression loops by keeping prior bug context visible at the point of change.
- Improves future debugging and reviews because tradeoffs and constraints are documented where they matter.
